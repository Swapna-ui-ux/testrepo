							<h3>Introduction</h3>
							<p>Aurobindo Pharma Foundation was established in 2015  as a philanthropic arm of Aurobindo Pharma Limited with an aim to change and improve the lives of the marginalised and socio-economically disadvantaged  communities, and strive to bring about these changes through our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme primarily focusing in business locations. However, CSR is more than just a legal obligation for us, we go beyond the CSR framework to take on a diverse array of projects based on the situational requirements and needs and necessities of the stakeholders/beneficiaries and to make meaningful social investments. The foundation is manned with professionals and experts to deal from conceptualization to execution and monitoring of various CSR projects besides engaging relevant agencies and subject matter experts on need basis. </p>
							<p>Our Foundation focusses its efforts on areas such as Education, Health &Sanitation, Eradicating Hunger & Poverty, Rural Development, Environmental Sustainability  to name a few, in order to realise its goals and produce significant changes in the lives of its stakeholders/beneficiaries. We have multiple ongoing flagship programmes, besides which, we have also undertaken partnership programmes with the local government bodies and have  also partnered up with various NGOs on different projects spanning multiple areas, both in past and at present. </p>
							<p>One of our flagship programmes  aims to counter malnutrition and promote zero hunger, good health and wellbeing; by funding the Hare Krishna Movement Charitable Foundation, we have built centralised automated kitchens in Narsingi, Hyderabad; Singupuram, Srikakulam and Mahboobnagar Town. These kitchens are equipped to provide 25,000-50,000 meals per day to students in Government schools, supply free food to in-patient attendants at various Government hospitals, farmers and underprivileged people. </p>

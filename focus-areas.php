											<p>Our areas of focus are diverse and dynamic, and the project we undertake are always based on the needs and necessities of our stakeholders. However, we do have few key areas that we focus on such as Education, Health, Rural Development, Nutrition, etc. This section briefly highlights our work and how it aligns with both the rules and regulations of the Companies Act, 2013, as well as several of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations.</p>

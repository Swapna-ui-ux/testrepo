								<h2>Key Message</h2>
								<p>
								Aurobindo Pharma Limited has been fostering a shared value of their business in the form of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) through their philanthropic arm – Aurobindo Pharma Foundation (APF), a registered trust and Section 8 company since its inception in 2015 with a strong vision and commitment towards society. Aurobindo Pharma Limited does exist with an immense belief that social investment is an opportunity to serve the marginalised communities and motivates the morale of the organization and the employees too. Our organization goes beyond the CSR framework and runs an extra mile based on the circumstances and situational requirements while duly following norms stipulated. We strongly wish that the shareholders of this company become stakeholders and partners in the community welfare programs and aim for a sustainable business development.
							   </p>

								<p>With this spirit, the organization has continued to take a focused discourse to make wise social investments in the area of CSR and is able to cover a wide range of initiatives across the sectors – education, health & nutrition, sustainable agriculture, water & sanitation, women and community’s empowerment. The scale of the programs is also much diversified- we have flagship programs, we have partnership programs with the government, we have collaborations with implementation expert NGOs, we have associated with national bodies, we have piloted new projects and we could actively respond in the Covid-19 crisis. Thus, our focus has been multiplied as we progressed over the years, and accordingly our CSR spending has been done judiciously. Innovation has been key in most of our projects to make them self-sustainable, as we learn through this journey of CSR metamorphosis.</p>

								<p>We envision CSR to be a culture of the organization, one that is able to influence and inspire others. Our CSR mandate is to align with the ESG principles of business and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UN. We strongly intend that our journey goes within the legal framework of the CSR Act while also fulfilling the true and immediate needs of the deserving communities.</p>
